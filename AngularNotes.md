# Comparison: React (One-way Binding) vs Angular (Two-way Binding)

---

## React (One-way Binding)

- **Data Flow:**
  - Unidirectional.
  - Data flows in one direction—from the model to the view.

- **Rendering:**
  - Changes in the data trigger a re-render of the UI.

---

## Angular (Two-way Binding)

- **Data Flow:**
  - Bidirectional.
  - Data can flow in both directions—changes in the model update the view, and changes in the view update the model.

- **Synchronization:**
  - Changes in the model automatically update the view, and changes in the view update the model.
